    "Weight matrix W1 (size = 6×3) stores the embeddings for all words.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each active word (cat and milk), we pick its row vector from W1.\n",

    "Let’s see how 👇\n",
    "\n",
    "🧩 Step 1: Input → One Word (Target)\n",

    "Target = “drinks”\n",
    "Context = [“cat”, “milk”, “daily”]\n",

    "W1 matrix = (vocab_size × embedding_dim)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row = embedding of one word\n",
    "\n",
    "When input = “drinks”,\n",

    "\n",
    "W1[\"drinks\"] = [0.7, 0.2, 0.9]\n",

    "→ this means “drinks” is represented using 3 features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each value shows how strongly the word “drinks” connects to each hidden feature.\n",

    "✅ So just like in CBOW — W1 still tells us word-to-feature relationship.\n",

    "🧠 Step 4: What’s Actually Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "After training on many sentences:\n",
    "\n",
    "“drinks” will move close (in feature space) to “milk”, “water”, “eat”, “juice” — all related words.\n",
    "\n",
    "“cat” will move close to “dog”, “pet”, “animal”, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "So W1 ends up storing meaningful word embeddings,\n",
    "where each word’s vector shows which hidden features it relates to.\n",
    "\n",
    "⚙️ Comparison Summary\n",
    "Concept\tCBOW\tSkip-Gram\n",
    "W1 meaning\tEach word → feature vector\tEach word → feature vector\n",
    "Direction\tContext → Target\tTarget → Context\n",
    "What W1 learns\tHow each word connects to features (semantics)\tSame — how each word connects to features (semantics)\n",
    "What’s different\tHow the model uses those embeddings (averaging vs predicting multiple)\tUses the same W1 idea but reversed logic\n",
    "🧮 Intuitive Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine these 3 hidden “features”:\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature 1\tFeature 2\tFeature 3\n",
    "“animal”\t“food/drink”\t“daily life”\n",
    "\n",
    "Now,\n",
    "\n",
    "“cat” → [0.9, 0.1, 0.2] → strongly related to animal\n",
    "\n",
    "“drinks” → [0.2, 0.8, 0.6] → strongly related to food/drink\n",
    "\n",
    "“milk” → [0.3, 0.9, 0.4] → strongly related to food/drink\n",
    "\n",
    "“dog” → [0.8, 0.2, 0.1] → strongly related to animal\n",
    "\n",
    "So in Skip-Gram, W1 still learns exactly this —\n",
    "how each word aligns with those internal “meaning” features.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Final Summary\n",
    "Question\tAnswer\n",
    "Does W1 learn “word ↔ feature” relationships?\t✅ Yes, in both CBOW and Skip-Gram\n",
    "What’s different between them?\tOnly how W1 gets updated (direction of prediction)\n",
    "What’s stored finally in W1?\tThe word embeddings — each word represented by feature values\n",
    "What’s W2’s job?\tHelps predict other words (context); not used as final embedding\n",
    "Which matrix do we save for embeddings?\t✅ W1 (the input → hidden weights)\n",
    "\n",
    "🧠 In simple words:\n",
    "\n",
    "In both CBOW and Skip-Gram,\n",
    "W1 is like a dictionary of meanings.\n",
    "Each word learns how much it belongs to different hidden features.\n",
    "The only difference is:\n",
    "\n",
    "CBOW learns it by averaging context to predict the center.\n",
    "\n",
    "Skip-Gram learns it by predicting contexts from the center."
